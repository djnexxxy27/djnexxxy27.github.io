            Hello! I'm Maggie 
          </p>
          <p>
            My name is Maggie Jaworski and I am a qualified Foot Health Practitioner, who also has nine years experience in care industry. Similar to a chiropodist or podiatrist, a foot health practitioner cares for all the common foot problems.
            I qualified as a Foot Health Practitioner at the SMAE Institute in Maidenhead. My clinical training was delivered by experienced podiatrists, who have worked in both the NHS and private sectors. The SMAE Institute provides continual professional development to keep members up to date and gives the opportunity to further their knowledge.
            I am a member of the Open College of Foot Health Professionals (MCFHP) and a member of the British Association of Foot Health Professionals (MAFHP).
            I am bound by the Code of Ethics, Rules of the Association and I am professionally insured and CRB-checked. I am also trained in medical emergency procedures.
            I provide a highly professional service where comfort, safety, hygiene and confidentiality are paramount.
